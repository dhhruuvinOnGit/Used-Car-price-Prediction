# Used Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, fuel type, and more. The model uses linear regression for prediction and is integrated with a Flask-based web interface, providing a user-friendly experience.


## Features

- **Linear Regression Model**: Uses linear regression to predict the price of a used car based on various input features.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A frontend that allows users to input car details and view the predicted price.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes cleaning to remove inconsistencies and preprocessing for better model accuracy.
- **Model Serialization**: The trained model is saved using `pickle` for quick loading and inference.
